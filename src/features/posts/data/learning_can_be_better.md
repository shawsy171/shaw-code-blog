# Learning can be better

I've been learning web dev for awhile now and I can't help be think there is a better way to learn and I think basing it on encoding and spaced retrieval is the best way to do it

So I basing the encoding idea on asking better and more questions

And spaced retrieval is based around projects, quizzes

## the idea

The basic idea is that I have been able to learn best, when I have taken the time to ask questions about the thing I'm learning why does it work that way and what else is this similar to.

I think this gives my brain more time to take the what I learning on board and connect it other things I already know

## Three steps to learning

1. Organise
   Organise the ideas in your mind so with async javascript code you use a time line of callbacks, Promises and async/await or you could organise using metaphor e.g. async code it like a waiter at a restaurant who takes your order and return with the data when it ready
2. recall
3. practice
